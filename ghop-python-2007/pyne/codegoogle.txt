OK, I'm sorry I didn't get farther (I was going to work yesterday but the power
went out :-( ).  Here's what the program can do so far:
- stores From, To, Subject, Date, CC, BCC, and message body in sqlite database.
- takes the text/plain message only if it's a multipart message (for the HTML
  requirement above)
- Prints out the list of emails in a pretty format
- Fairly advanced search syntax allows user to limit searches to a particular
  field or do a full-text search (searches all headers + message)
- When searching by date, natural language input is allowed
- When searching by date, ranges are allowed (e.g., 4th of july to december
  16th, 2006)
- Accepts most all messages without choking
- UI resizes to fit the screen (must re-run program)
- Dates reformat as their column gets smaller
- Detection of "name <email>" form, does the right thing depending on column
  width (i.e., displays email when there is no name, name when there is not
  enough space for name and email, and name and email when there is enough
  room).

4 different modes:
- "./pyne.py insert" adds an email to the database.  Can pipe to stdin or put
  a filename at the end.  Can take multiple filenames, a combination of
  filenames and stdin, just stdin, or just 1 filename.
- "./pyne.py list" prints all of the email headers in the database in a nice
  6-column view.
- "./pyne.py search query" where query is your query will search the database.
  "%" is a multicharacter wild card and "_" is a single character wild card.
  Query can be a combination of "tokens" which take 2 forms:
   - "x:y" where x is the header to search (from, to, etc.; case-insensitive)
     and y is the search term.  Put quotes (single or double) around y to have
     a multiword search term.  Multiple x:y sets will be ANDed together.
       - "date:y" where will search for emails sent on a certain date.  Natural
         language processing is used, so y can be just about any date-like
         verbiage.
       - "date:'y to z' will use the same natural language processing to search
         for all emails sent between y and z.
   - "x" will search for "x" anywhere in the email, including the body and all
     stored headers.
- "./pyne.py display query" works as "./pyne.py search query" but it displays
  the body of the emails.

Could be improved:
- Input multiple emails from one file.
- Changing column width based on content.  For example, if there were no CC-
  fields in a certain result set, don't display that column.
- Being able to use NOT and OR in queries.

I Stole Stuff From:
- http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/2000-May/033365.html for the
  code that determines the console width.
- http://labix.org/python-dateutil (mainly) for the natural language date
  processing.

Uploaded Files:
- pyne.py is the stuff I wrote.
- There pyne.tar.bz2 with pyne.py and the date processing library.

Examples:
(Data is generated randomly, I don't know why some From fields are missing.  It
 doesn't happen with my actual emails.  I tested extensively with my personal
 emails so these examples don't show off encoding detection or anything too
 special.)

Resized terminal, all columns shrunk and date switched to mm/dd/yy.
There are other date options on the larger side as well.

Search for "charles" in the From field only:
daniel@daniel-desktop:~/ghop/email_database$ ./pyne.py search from:charles
    From    |     To     |  Subject   |    Date    |     Cc     |    Bcc

 Charles R. | James S. G | Always fig | Nov 21, 03 | He's got s | Duis aute  

Search for emails from Charles to James:
daniel@daniel-desktop:~/ghop/email_database$ ./pyne.py search 'from:charles to:james'
    From    |     To     |  Subject   |    Date    |     Cc     |    Bcc     
 Charles R. | James S. G | Always fig | Nov 21, 03 | He's got s | Duis aute  

Let's look at the body of that email (they all have Dan Finnie in the body):
daniel@daniel-desktop:~/ghop/email_database$ ./pyne.py display 'from:charles to:james'
    From    |     To     |  Subject   |    Date    |     Cc     |    Bcc     
 Charles R. | James S. G | Always fig | Nov 21, 03 | He's got s | Duis aute  
Dan Finnie Dan Finnie Dan Finnie...

Because they all have Dan Finnie in the body, a search for "Dan Finnie" should
get the same results as the "list" command:
daniel@daniel-desktop:~/ghop/email_database$ ./pyne.py list | wc
    101    1800    7878
daniel@daniel-desktop:~/ghop/email_database$ ./pyne.py search "Dan Finnie" | wc
    101    1800    7878

Now let's look at some date processing:
daniel@daniel-desktop:~/ghop/email_database$ ./pyne.py search "date:'nov 12 2002'"
    From    |     To     |  Subject   |    Date    |     Cc     |    Bcc     
 George C.  | Brian K. C | I've gotte | Nov 12, 02 | Soaring th | Who says y 

Is the same as:
daniel@daniel-desktop:~/ghop/email_database$ ./pyne.py search "date:'11/12/02'"
    From    |     To     |  Subject   |    Date    |     Cc     |    Bcc     
 George C.  | Brian K. C | I've gotte | Nov 12, 02 | Soaring th | Who says y 

Let's look at who sent mail in November 2002:
daniel@daniel-desktop:~/ghop/email_database$ ./pyne.py search "date:'11/1/02 to 11/30/02'"
    From    |     To     |  Subject   |    Date    |     Cc     |    Bcc     
            | Jennifer W | He's got s | Nov 25, 02 | I might ju | There's a
